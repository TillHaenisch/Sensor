Node
====
This directory contains the code for the sensor nodes. It is written in for the Arduino platform. There are two variants: The XBeeSens is for nodes with only one HYT 939 sensor, the XBSens_OT is for one HYT939 and two ADT7410 sensors per node.

It would be nice to put these two together in one version that automatically detects, which sensors are attached .....
